## Syntax

```ts
import { pipeFn } from '@opentf/std';

pipeFn(
  ...fns: Function[]
): (...args: unknown[]) => unknown
```

## Examples

```ts
const transform = pipeFn(Math.pow, Math.abs);
transform(-2, 3); //=> 8
```

## Try

<REPL code={`const { pipeFn } = require('@opentf/std');

const transform = pipeFn(Math.pow, Math.abs);
transform(-2, 3);
`} />

## Learn

Why we need function composition?

- The deep nesting of functions is hard to read.
- It eliminates temporary variables.
- Method chaining is limited, for Eg: await, yeild, etc.
