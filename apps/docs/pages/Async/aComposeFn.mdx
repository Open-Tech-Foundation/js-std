> Returns a function that performs functions composition from right to left asynchronously.

<Callout type="default">
  The `compose` function is equivalent to `a(b(c(val)))`.
</Callout>

## Syntax

```ts
import { aComposeFn } from '@opentf/std';

aComposeFn(
  ...fns: Function[]
): (...args: unknown[]) => unknown
```

## Examples

```ts
const transform = aComposeFn((x) => Promise.resolve(Math.ceil(x)), Math.pow);
await transform(1.5, 2.5); //=> 3
```

## Try

<REPL code={`const { aComposeFn } = require('@opentf/std');

async function main() {
const transform = aComposeFn(
(x) => Promise.resolve(Math.ceil(x)),
Math.pow
);
log(await transform(1.5, 2.5));
}

main();
`} />

## Learn

Why we need function composition?

- The deep nesting of functions is hard to read.
- It eliminates temporary variables.
- Method chaining is limited, for Eg: await, yeild, etc.
