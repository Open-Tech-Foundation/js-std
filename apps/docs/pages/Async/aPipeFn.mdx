> Returns a function that performs functions composition from left to right asynchronously.

<Callout type="default">
  The `pipe` function is equivalent to `c(b(a(val)))`.
</Callout>

## Syntax

```ts
import { aPipeFn } from '@opentf/std';

aPipeFn(
  ...fns: Function[]
): (...args: unknown[]) => unknown
```

## Examples

```ts
const transform = aPipeFn(
  (s) => capitalize(s),
  (x) => Promise.resolve(`Welcome ${x}`),
  (x) => Promise.resolve(`${x}...`)
);
await transform("guest"); //=> 'Welcome Guest...'
```

## Try

<REPL code={`const { aPipeFn, capitalize } = require('@opentf/std');

async function main() {
const transform = aPipeFn(
(s) => capitalize(s),
(x) => Promise.resolve(\`Welcome \${x}\`),
(x) => Promise.resolve(\`\${x}...\`)
);
const out = await transform('guest');
log(out);
}

main();
`} />

## Learn

Why we need function composition?

- The deep nesting of functions is hard to read.
- It eliminates temporary variables.
- Method chaining is limited, for Eg: await, yeild, etc.
