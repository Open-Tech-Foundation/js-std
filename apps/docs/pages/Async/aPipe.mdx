> Performs functions composition from left to right asynchronously.

<Callout type="default">
  The `pipe` function is equivalent to `c(b(a(val)))`.

## Syntax

```ts
import { aPipe } from '@opentf/std';

aPipe(
  val: unknown,
  ...fns: Function[]
): Promise<unknown>
```

## Examples

```ts
await aPipe(
  "guest",
  (s) => capitalize(s),
  (x) => Promise.resolve(`Welcome ${x}`)
); //=> 'Welcome Guest'
```

## Try

<REPL code={`const { aPipe, capitalize } = require('@opentf/std');

async function main() {
const out = await aPipe('guest',
(s) => capitalize(s),
(x) => Promise.resolve(\`Welcome \${x}\`)
);
log(out);
}

main();
`} />

## Learn

Why we need function composition?

- The deep nesting of functions is hard to read.
- It eliminates temporary variables.
- Method chaining is limited, for Eg: await, yeild, etc.
