> Performs functions composition from right to left asynchronously.

<Callout type="default">
  The `compose` function is equivalent to `a(b(c(val)))`.
</Callout>

## Syntax

```ts
import { aCompose } from '@opentf/std';

aCompose(
  val: unknown,
  ...fns: Function[]
): Promise<unknown>
```

## Examples

```ts
await aCompose(
  1,
  (x) => Promise.resolve(x + 1),
  (x) => Promise.resolve(x * 5)
); //=> 6
```

## Try

<REPL code={`const { aCompose } = require('@opentf/std');

async function main() {
const out = await aCompose(1,
(x) => Promise.resolve(x + 1),
(x) => Promise.resolve(x \* 5)
);
log(out);
}

main();
`} />

## Learn

Why we need function composition?

- The deep nesting of functions is hard to read.
- It eliminates temporary variables.
- Method chaining is limited, for Eg: await, yeild, etc.
